# TTR500 Labview Driver (Coming soon!)
In Labview, Each VI corresponds to a programmatic operation, such as configuring, reading from, writing to, and triggering an instrument. LabVIEW instrument drivers simplify instrument control and reduce test program development time by eliminating the need for you to learn the complex, low-level programming commands for each instrument.  

NOTE: This Driver and other LabView components will be deployed via [GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-package-registry)  

## Installation
Copy to C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2012\instr.lib  

(Can be any LabVIEW version starts from 2012)  

TTR500 should now be available from the Instrument I/O palette.
